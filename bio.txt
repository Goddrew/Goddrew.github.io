I aim to advance the knowledge in reinforcement learning with the purpose to better understand human intelligence at the levels of individuals and societies. I am especially interested in deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and imitation learning. Specifically, and not limited to, the problem of creating general agents with the flexibility to adapt within a constantly changing environment and the ability to assist and cooperate with other agents and humans to improve their collective welfare.
